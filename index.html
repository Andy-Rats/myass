        <p id="fartgag">okay so i am about to tell you a secret
            are you ready to hear the secret?
            <br>
            . <br>
            .
            <br>
            okay, so slight problem; i don't know how to program a way for you to answer...
             sooo if you aren't ready get out now okay?  <br>
            .<br>
            .<br>
            .<br>
            i am warning you this is a very dangerous secret
            .<br>
            .<br>
            .<br>
            .<br>
            .<br>
            .<br>
            .<br>
            .<br>

            OH you're still here?? cool beans, sooo the secret is: <br>
            over the last few years i have been developing a button, a secret button.
            a button who's function is so absurdly powerful that should you try to press it, your mind will break!
            <br>
            yes some have tried to create such a button before
            <br>
            <br>
            during ww2 the nazis have thought up an idea, the idea was of a button SO DANGEROUS that reality itself would've been at stake!!
            they were trying to create the button that i have been able to make, however, fortunetly they were stopped by a team of brave norwegian men. <br>
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1266854231411785778/1318872490080075786/COMMANDER_MOOSE.png?ex=6763e739&is=676295b9&hm=a846d2280f00cc07a8e22c76d2c0cdcc6ce3c38d78e2ddd02c5805c3aa1680c0&" alt="">
            <br>
        
            unforunatly, i found out about the danger of the button a moment too late. i had already made that cursed thing. <br>
            i know i will never know forgivness from the lord, for i have made doom. i have destroyed mankind, and i, have effectivly buried us all. 
            and for that, all i can do is apologize. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            when i first envisioned the button, i had imagined a great creation, my magnum opus, THE ULTIMATE CREATION, a tool for the people! for humanity!
             but i was tricked by it's evil charm.
            <br>
            <br>
            the button desired to exist, it has been trying through different minds throught the ages to create itself, but always failed. until now that is.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            what i am doing now, is releasing the button, to you, and only you. i trust no one else with it's power. i know your heart is pure, and i am deeply sorry for the burden
            i am placing upon you, but i see no other way. this button is, despite everything, my magnum opus, my ultimate creation, i cannot bring myself to destroy it.
            but i know it isn't right, i know one of these days i will be seduced by it's power, and that is why, i leave it to you. press it, kiss it, i don't care. <br>
            i've created this button to benefit humanity, and even if it can't do that, at the very least it can benefit you.
            <br>
            <br>
            please take care of my button <br>
